Originally introduced in 2017, the V-Core went through several iterations and multiple variants over time,\u00a0through a process of continuously\u00a0seeking user feedback to drive product development. The lessons learned over the years allowed us to understand what works and what\u00a0doesn't, what features are most valued by users, and what choices ensure both quality and affordability. We've distilled all this knowledge into the V-Core 3, which was designed in partnership with Pawel Kucmus, a long time member of our on-line community and one of the most prolific contributors to the V-Core platform. </p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>Order Now!</p>","title":"V-Core 3"},{"location":"#precision","text":"<ul> <li> 3 Point Kinematic Bed</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Bed plates expand as they heat up. If their mounting points are unmovable, the bed will have no room to expand to the sides, and it will be forced to bow (either upwards or downwards). The V-Core 3 bed plate is not rigidly connected to the machine's frame. Instead, 3 steel balls connected to the bed sit on low friction dowel pins. The pins act like a pair of rails for the steel balls, guiding their movement as the bed expands and ensuring that only radial movement is possible - there's zero margin for lateral movement. This means that while your plate is firmly in place, it can still remain perfectly flat as it expands.</p> <p>Since the bed only has 3 mounting points, which are connected to 3 independently driven Z motors, bed-levelling is exclusively determined by motor position and can be done 100% electronically - simple and instantaneous.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> 6mm Cast Tooling Plate for Print bed</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> Immaculate CoreXY Belt Path</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> All movement guided by MGN12 Linear Rails</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> Doubled Z resolution with TR8x4 Lead Screws instead of TR8x8</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>The V-Core 3 uses 3 lead screws to drive the Z axis of the machine. They move the bed down in small increments, at the end of each complete layer. The Z axis moves very slowly, so speed is not the priority - precision and resolution are.  The V-Core 3 uses TR8X4mm lead screws instead of the TR8x8mm used in previous machines, effectively halving the pitch of the lead screw - this means that each rotation of the motor, now moves the bed half as much. This both doubles the Z resolution of your layers and multiplies the holding torque - always helpful when you're moving such a heavy bed, especially on the larger variants.</p>","title":"Precision"},{"location":"#robustness","text":"<p>While previous V-Core versions, like many other printers on the market, relied solely on 20 Series profiles, the V-Core 3 is fully built on a 30 Series aluminium frame.

I didn\u2018t know any better and thought it was standard for a machine with 3 z motors, and I was a bit skeptic about the new design. Now, after one month of operation, I know better.
